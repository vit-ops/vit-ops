# vit-ops

Developer focused on **Web Development**, building modern, performant, and well-structured solutions. I have a solid foundation across multiple programming paradigms, allowing me to work comfortably with low-level systems, scripting, and web applications.

My work is guided by **code clarity**, **best practices**, **clean architecture**, and **continuous learning**. I prioritize understanding the problem deeply before proposing solutions, aiming for maintainability, efficiency, and long-term value.

## Professional Overview

I primarily operate within the web ecosystem, developing applications that balance performance, security, and user experience. In parallel, I maintain hands-on experience with lower-level and scripting languages, which strengthens my ability to analyze, optimize, and automate systems.

I am particularly interested in projects involving:

* Scalable web systems
* Cross-technology integrations
* Well-documented and testable codebases
* Technical solutions with real-world impact

## Technologies and Languages

Practical experience with the following languages, applied across different contexts:

* **Web Development**: primary focus, with strong attention to architecture, performance, and structure
* **C / C++**: low-level understanding, memory management, and performance optimization
* **Python**: automation, scripting, and application support
* **JavaScript (Scripting)**: logic, automation, and interactions
* **Lua**: lightweight scripting and system integration

This versatility allows me to select the most appropriate tool for each technical challenge.
